Tested using multimeter to measure voltage on the power stage = 5.80
Applied 2 signals from signal generator, first 4 peak=to-peak, then 10v peak-to-peak,
results shown on the image screen capture

Final tuning will be done using coils connected 
Second set of pictures needed for distance/voltage proportionality
